*****Notes: WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR PREPOPULATION SINCE THE FIELDS IN THE DATABASE CHANGED*****
WE NEED TO FIX OUR QUERY NOW THAT DATE AND TIME ARE OBJECTS, COULD YOU DO THAT?

WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THE EVENTID TO BE A STRING, BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THE FRONTEND CAN SEND US AN EVENTID ASSOCIATED WITH
A SPECIFIC SIGNUP IS IF THEY USE SOME OF THE INFO FROM THE EVENT
COMBINED (EG REUBEN WAS SUGGESTING NAME+TIME OR A SEGMENT OF THAT).
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK IF ONLY THE BACKEND TAKES CARE OF THE 
EVENTID AND THE FRONTEND HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT IS, SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
LET THE FRONTEND ASSIGN THE EVENTID WHEN IT'S CREATED


Put new events function 
DONE:
assumed getting times and date as objects for now

hardcoded creator for now


Put people in the student table function

Signup function
DONE:
not sure if the update is right, would it work with the 'signedup_number = signedup_number + 1', or do we have to do a select first to get the number?

why is waitlist netid an integer? and what do you want to do with it for now? I just put a 0 rn

Expiration stuff 

Fetch function for the owner of the activity
